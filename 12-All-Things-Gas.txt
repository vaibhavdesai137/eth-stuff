# Four things about gas:
#
# Gas:
#	- This is units of gas the txn creator is offering
#	- This is the upper bound
#	- Any txn WILL NEVER use more gas than specified by the sender
# Gas Price:
#	- This is the price per unit of gas the txn creator is willing to pay
#	- Offered in WEI
#	- So essentially, the creator is offering a total fees of (#gas x #gas-price)
# Gas Usage:
#	- This is the actual gas used for verfifying the txn
#	- For smart contracts with buggy code, if the code keeps executing, gas usage will keep going up
#	- If (#gas-usage < #gas-offered), the excessive gas is returned to sender
#	- If (#gas-usage > #gas-offered), the txn is marked as failed right there
# 	- if the txn is cancelled (for whatever reason), the gas is still paid out because the miner had to use the computational power
# 	- The sender will never get the whole gas back

# From testrpc logs for 1st txn:
# eth_sendTransaction
# 	- Transaction: 0xe1584a109bc67f20f627af62d9a4e984fdc1f51a001b66e174b0aa56dcab49a2
#  	- Gas usage: 186938

> eth.getTransaction('0xe1584a109bc67f20f627af62d9a4e984fdc1f51a001b66e174b0aa56dcab49a2');
{
  ...
  gas: 4712388,
  gasPrice: 100000000000
  ...
}

# Sender was offering the following:
# Max gas = 4712388
# WEIs per unit of gas = 100000000000

# GAS OFFERED:
# So, max txn fees beings offered = 4712388 * 100000000000 WEIs
# which is 0.04712388 ETH

# GAS USED:
# But from the testrpc logs, the actual gas usage was only 186938 for that txn
# 186938 * 100000000000
# which is 0.0186938 ETH

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CONST function calls in smart contract NEVER create a txn
# The method is executed on the node itself and no gas is used

# Functions without CONST will result a new txn on the block
# And the same dicussion about gas, gas prices, gas limit, etc. applies
