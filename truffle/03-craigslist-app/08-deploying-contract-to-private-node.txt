# testrpc is much different than full ethereum nodes
# For example, testrpc:
#   - has everything in-mmeory (start/stop loses all blocks)
#   - block are mined right away giving the impression its synchronous (real nodes will take time)
#   - difficulty is 0
#   - all accounts are unlocked by default
#   - each block has a single txn

# At one point, we'll have to deploy to private node, test networks, main network
# We'll deploy to private node in this one...

# Try testing our contracts again and again repeatedly

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If you try running the tests again and again, you will notice that the "events" test sometimes passes and sometimes fails
# This has to do with how we have written it
# On testrpc, since everything is rocket fast, we never saw this issue
# But on a real blockchain we are seeing this
# The test needs to be re-written in a different way

# Check the changes made to testcase #3 in test/CraigslistHappyPath.js

# Now the test will pass all the time

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Lets deploy the contract now
# Make sure your MetMask sees the same account that is mining our blockchain and not the testrpc accounts
$ truffle migrate --reset

# Try creating a few listings
# Kill our private node and start it again
# You will still see those items
# Its because they were created on our private actual blockchain (and not on testrp)
# WooHoo
