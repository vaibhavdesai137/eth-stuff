# Inheritance in solidity is like other languages
# Helps reuse code and extend code
# Multiple inheritance is supported
# Abstract contracts supported
# Interface contracts supported

# EVM has no notion of Inheritance/Interface/Abstract constracts
# During compile time, all the contracts are merged together and deployed as one
