# Its a chrome extension
# Get it from https://metamask.io/
# Does not need local nodes. It can work with nodes running on Metamask's servers
# So if you ant to work with mainnet, you don't need to set it up on your machine and wait for whole blockchain to be downloaded
# Can connect to mainnet, any test nets, local nodes, etc.
# Widely used and major industry adoption
# Major use is its a DApp compliant platform

# BE VERY CAREFUL SINCE METAMASK CAN CONNECT TO MAINNET

# Since metamask runs in crowser, it does not have access to our privte node's keystore
# All accounts created via metamask have their data in the extension itself
# As a result, metamask cannot see the accounts created outside of metamask even though you are connected to local node
# This is because browser extension does not have access to file system
# Similarly, accounts created via metamask will not be visible in mist or geth console
# Reason mist and geth can see each others changes is because both share the same geth.ipc file

# Metamask provides an import account option to see accounts created by mist/geth
# By default, you will see "Account 1" in metamask which itself created when launching the extension
# We want metamask to see the 4 accounts we created in our private node
